## All new language - but still the same
Python offers new opportunities for MyOS, but it makes PyOS look very similar to MyOS.

## Fast updates and easy porting of existing features
Because Python is generaly easy, it allows for fast feature porting

## Unix support!
Because Python is a multi-platform coding language, it allows for Unix support, for example Linux and Darwin.
